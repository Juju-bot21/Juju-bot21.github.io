            Hi, my name is Julien Nal, and I am a student at Kettering Fairmont High School. The three things that could
            be said to describe me are technology, music, and self-improvement. I am currently in classes to major in
            cyber security when I go to college, while also working and going to the gym every day. My interest in cyber
            security developed from a young age when I started playing video games. When I'm not in school, you’ll find
            me at the gym, work, or playing pickleball. I believe that any mistake can lead to improvement, and it is
            one of the sayings I live by.

            I am currently a senior at Fairmont High School and have plans to go to the University of Cincinnati for
            college. I want to major in cyber security and minor in computer science. From a young age, computers and
            technology in general have always fascinated me. I’ve always played games, whether it be on an old Xbox One,
            Wii, or PlayStation. Growing up surrounded by games has shaped my future career choice. My interest in
            cybersecurity peaked when I first learned about anonymous hackers. Seeing how hackers could compromise
            personal information and bank accounts infuriated me. From that point on, I knew I wanted my future career
            to deal with cybersecurity. In today’s age, it's rare to step into a space with little to no technology. Our
            world is changing with the introduction of new technology every day, and I feel like I could make a big
            difference in the future by ensuring that this new technology is safe.

            Music to me is like water to a fish. I could not live without it because of how much it means to me. I truly
            feel like myself when I'm surrounded by music. I grew up listening to a lot of rhythm and blues because of
            my mom, and my love for that type of music has carried on through the years. So many songs instantly
            increase my mood and make me feel on top of the world, and the best thing about music is that it's
            accessible anywhere. Whether in my room, at the gym, or driving in my car, there’s a different genre for any
            scenario and time of day.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you asked any of my peers, they would say that I love the gym and self-improvement. For the past 2 years,
            I've been going to the gym consistently and have seen significant improvements in my body. I love the gym
            because it’s a place where anyone is accepted and can go to improve themselves.
