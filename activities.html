            <p class="gym">I started going to the gym at the end of the 8th grade year. My cousin Alec introduced me to
                lifting and I’ve
                been obsessed with it since. When I wasn’t working, or doing my school sports, I could always be found
                in
                the gym.

            <p class="pickleball">
                I started playing pickleball at the end of my junior year summer. Ever since then, I’ve played
                pickleball nearly everyday trying to improve. It's a fun activity that I can enjoy with friends and
                family without putting too much strain on my body.
